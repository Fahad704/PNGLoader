to read and decompress the idat chunks we have to first concatenate all idat data then read it one by one

A deflate block has 2 parts
	-pair of Huffman  trees
	-lz77 compressed data blocks

lz77 compresses data by using 32k prior bytes(in deflate) and reference a repeating string(multiple bytes) 
the reference consists of length and distance , where distance represents the offset of bytes from current byte to
the prior repeating byte.

Huffman coding is a variable-length-code where the length of a character depends on its frequency , characters with more frequency get a 
low length code.
