Deflate info
->has multiple blocks
->in png it is zlib stream with deflate blocks
->zlib stream starts with 2 byte header
->deflate block has 2 parts , huffman trees and encoded data
Deflate format
Deflate block:
    byte 1
        -3 bit header (Big endian)
        bit 0 - last block in stream marker
        bit 1-2 
            - 00 = A stored section between 0 and 65,535 bytes in length
            - 01 = Static huffman compressed block , using huffman tree in the rfc
            - 10 = Dynamic huffman compressed block , with huffman table supplied
            - 11 = reserved dont use
        >skip to byte boundary
    byte 2 - 3 make up LEN = length of block
    byte 4 - 5 make up NLEN = complement of LEN

    byte 6... = LEN bytes of literals
